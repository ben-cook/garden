After Pavement, Radiohead have been selected as the next band to explore the
themes and motifs of. In this article, I'll explain why Ok Computer is the best
album.

#### The Bends

###### Tracklist:

1. Planet Telex
2. The Bends
3. High and Dry
4. Fake Plastic Trees
5. Bones
6. (Nice Dream)
7. Just
8. My Iron Lung
9. Bullet Proof..I Wish I Was
10. Black Star
11. Sulk
12. Street Spirit (Fade Out)

###### Standout Tracks:

- High and Dry
  - The strongest chorus on the album
- Fake Plastic Trees
  - Another obvious pick, but I can't deny the intensity building and building
    in this song absolutely rocks
- Black Star
  - The second best song named this, after Bowie's Blackstar

###### Review:

The Bends is good, but none of the songs stick out as all time top Radiohead
songs. A very solid album in the discography.

#### Ok Computer

###### Tracklist:

1. Airbag
2. Paranoid Android
3. Subterranean Homesick Alien
4. Exit Music (For a Film)
5. Let Down
6. Karma Police
7. Fitter Happier
8. Electioneering
9. Climbing Up the Walls
10. No Surprises
11. Lucky
12. The Tourist

###### Standout Tracks:

- Paranoid Android
  - This song has it all for me: the laidback acoustic guitar and the operatic
    vocals contrasted with the hard, slightly prog-rock-esque guitar solos
    tickles my pickle
- Exit Music (For a Film)
  - How could I not choose this one? Haunting and beautiful
- Karma Police
  - I'm not sure I actually like this song more than the honourable mentions.
    It's catchy though
- Honourable mentions: Electioneering, Let Down

###### Review:

Wow, an absolute banger. Full of songs that go hard, with loud drums and
electric guitar. I like it.

#### Kid A

![Kid A Album Cover 220x220px](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/Radioheadkida.png/220px-Radioheadkida.png)

###### Tracklist:

1. Everything in Its Right Place
2. Kid A
3. The National Anthem
4. How to Disappear Completely
5. Treefingers
6. Optimistic
7. In Limbo
8. Idioteque
9. Morning Bell
10. Motion Picture Soundtrack
11. Untitled

###### Standout Tracks:

- Everything in Its Right Place
  - So textural, so good
- How to Disappear Completely
  - Like the rest of the album, quite slow and melancholic
- Idioteque
  - Has a cool rhythm section, lots of percussion I like

###### Review:

It's quite pretty and makes great use of layered textures to build a cohesive
soundscape throughout the entire album. None of the songs absolutely hard
though, which is a bold choice. I think I would like a couple songs that go
hard.

#### Amnesiac
