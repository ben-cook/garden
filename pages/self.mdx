# How I created my Digital Garden

I chose Next.js as the javascript framework to use for this blog for it's ease
of use and great SEO support.

Then I decided to use TailwindCSS to style the blog, because it's the hot thing
to do right now and web development is all about chasing trends, right?

I knew I wanted to write without using regular React components everywhere,
because they're a PITA. I thought about use a CMS<Reference id={1} text="I've
also had bad experiences recently trying out Strapi" side="right"/>, but even
fancy CMS's don't facilitate embedding fancy web elements very well. For these
reasons, I decided to try out [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). It's been a huge
success, allowing me to customise my Markdown components with Tailwind and
allowing me to embed cool [sidenotes](https://www.gwern.net/Sidenotes) as well.
One downside is that all the content is stored in the source of the website - no
pretty CMS to write in for me. However, Prettier can be configured to produce a
pretty nice MDX experience - for example, line lengths of `80` are useful for
writing, but is too low for regular JSX / React components in my opinion.
